  "summary": "REQ-2 and REQ-3 appear implemented: a /facts route is added to the TanStack Router (lazy-loaded) and \"Facts\" navigation links are added to both desktop and mobile nav (mobile closes on click). REQ-1 is only partially evidenced because the FactsPage render output is truncated; the diff shows a facts array and shadcn Card imports but does not clearly show an H1 and a bulleted/numbered list being rendered with the intended styling.",
