# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add a dedicated, easy-to-find Tips page that presents drinking-water tips in a readable, responsive layout consistent with the site’s “Golden Water” visual style.

**Planned changes:**
- Add a new lazy-loaded TanStack Router route at `/tips` and include it in the app route tree.
- Build a responsive Tips page UI with an English page title and the provided drinking-water tips rendered as a readable list using existing components and Tailwind styling.
- Add a “Tips” navigation link to both the desktop header navigation and the mobile menu, accessible without authentication.

**User-visible outcome:** Users can navigate to `/tips` (or use the “Tips” link in desktop/mobile navigation) to view hydration tips on a page that matches the existing site design.
